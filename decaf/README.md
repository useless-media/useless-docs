# DeCaf
DeCaf is an alternative to Google’s Cast Application Framework better known as Caf.
It is built directly on the hardware eliminating all the bulky application code making it both significantly faster
as well as infinitely more versatile than Google's “one box fits all” Chromecast solution.
Decaf allows you to build exactly what you want, exactly how you want to do it.
