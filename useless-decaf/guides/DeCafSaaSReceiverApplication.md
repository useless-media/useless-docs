# DeCaf SaaS Receiver Application

The DeCaf SaaS Receiver Application is a Chromecast receiver application maintained and hosted by
[Useless Media](https://useless.media). Using it you can run your DeCaf client(s) in both a test and production setup.

## Development/test application id
`DEADBEEF` <!-- ToDo: Get real id -->

The development application is only meant for development and testing purposes and imposes runtime limitations making it
not usable in a production scenario.

## Production application id
`DEADBEEF` <!-- ToDo: Get real id -->

The production application will not run if you do not provide a valid DeCaf license.

## Licensing
You can request a production license [here](ToDo:LinkHere). We will then get in touch with you to sort out the details
and give you instructions on how to provide your license to the SaaS application.

## Custom production application id
To simplify your integration so that you don't need to keep providing you license every time we can also provide you
with a custom production application id. In order to obtain that you will need to get in touch with us at
[Useless Media](https://useless.media).
