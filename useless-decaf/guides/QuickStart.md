# Quick Start

For more detailed explanations of how a client works and how to build your own, checkout the guides for the
[DeCaf Client Sdk](https://useless-media.github.io/useless-docs/useless-decaf/#/guides/index).

1. Clone the repo `@useless-media/useless-decaf-client-demo`
2. run: `npm i`
3. run: `npm run start:dev`

        This will build the project to `dist/esm/index.js` and start serving the root of the project on port: 9040

4. Check which demo client is exported as `DeCafClient` in: `src/ts/index.ts`
5. Make changes in that one, or, make your own and update the export in the index to use your client

You can now use `http://localhost:9040/dist/esm/index.js` as `DeCafClientUrl` and run your client in the
[Useless Emu-Later](guides/UselessEmuLater.md). Alternatively, you can use `http://[YourLocalIp]:9040/dist/esm/index.js`
which will also work to test your client on a real Chromecast device using the `DeCaf SaaS Receiver Application`.
