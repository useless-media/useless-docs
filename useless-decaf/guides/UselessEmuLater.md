# The Useless Emu-Later
Your one-stop-shop for all your Chromecast development needs. The Useless Emu-Later can act as an emulator for a real
Chromecast device, taking away a lot of the pain of developing for Chromecast when you can just test your changes
locally.

And once you feel confident about your updates it also provides an integration towards real devices, so you can use
the same test setup and development tools to test on a real device simply by changing the target from the emulator to
your device giving you the exact same way of working whether you're using the emulator or a real device.

The Emu-Later works best in conjunction with the [DeCaf framework](https://decaf.cc), but it will also happily run any
standard CAF receiver.
